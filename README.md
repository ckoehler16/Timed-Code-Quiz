# Timed-Code-Quiz

## Purpose
* To generate a timed quiz that asks a few questions to test a potential web developer's knowledge of JavaScript and stores the high scores in order to compare with others who have taken the quiz.

## Requirements
* Landing page with a start button that when one clicks the "start" button the timer starts and the first multiple choice question appears.
* Once a question is answered the next question appears while the timer continues to count down.
* If a question is answered in correctly then time is subtracted from the clock.
* The quiz is over when all the questions are answered or the timer has reached 0.
* When the quiz is over there is an opportunity to save one's initials and score.
* The high scores are stored and can be viewed
